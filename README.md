AI-Based Number Guessing Game

Introduction

The AI-Based Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides hints at specific intervals to assist players and includes a leaderboard to track high scores.

Why We Created This Game

This game was developed to enhance logical thinking and problem-solving skills while making the number guessing experience more engaging. By integrating AI-like hint systems, players can make more informed guesses rather than relying on pure luck. It also serves as a great learning project for beginners in Python, introducing them to concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and random number generation.

Features

Multiple Difficulty Levels: Choose between Easy (1-50), Medium (1-100), and Hard (1-200).

Intelligent Hint System:

Parity Hint (Even/Odd) after 5 attempts.

Divisibility Hint after 10 attempts.

Range Hint after 15 attempts.

Leaderboard: Tracks and displays the highest scores.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and interactive gameplay.

Replay Option: Players can choose to play again after each round.

AI-Like Guidance: The hint system acts like an AI assistant guiding the player.
